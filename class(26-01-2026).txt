Bootstrapping:
we want to estimate the median of the population
based on the sample.
X-->x1,x2,x3------------------xn
sample_sime=m 
no_samples=1000
we doing the random sampling...
s1------>x1,x2------xm---->m1
s2------>x2,x4,x5---xm---->m2



s1000--->x1,x2,----xm------>m1000

m1,m2,m3--------m1000
sort all theses medians in ascending order .
m1,m2,m3--------m1000
CI=95%
[m1,m950] with CI 95%.

Hypothesis Testing:
-important concept in statistics.
ex:
you have a headache--->Glucose tablet.
headache--->recover.-->placebo effect.
 50         50
  x         y 
class1    class2 
x-->heights of a student in class1 
y-->heights of a student in class2 
is there any diff in the height of a student in class1
and class2?
soution:
meu1--->avg height of student in class1 
meu2--->avg height of student in class2

suppose meu1-meu2=0

to quantify this we required a Hypothesis testing.

Hypothesis Testing is a proof by contradiction.

process of Hypothesis:
step1:define a Test statistics 
     meu1--->heights of student in class1
	 meu2--->heights of student in class2 
	 test statistics=meu1-meu2
step2:defined the hypothesis:
-we have a two types of hypothesis:
 H0--->Null hypothesis 
 H1--->Alternate Hypothesis(inverse of H0)
 H0:There is no difference in the heights of a 
    students in class1 and class2
 H1:There is difference in the heights of a 
    students in class1 and class2
	
step3:find the p_value
to find the p_value we need to design the experiment
p_value=probability observing test statistics given
that the Null hypothesis is True.
P_value=P(observing TS|H0 is True) 
test statistics=meu1-meu2 
meu1-meu2=5cm
H0 is True
P=(meu1-meu2=5cm|there is no diff)=0.9=90%

Step4:specify the significance level
generally we are considering 5% sig level.
if p_value>5%--->H0 is accepted
             --->H1 is rejected
if p_value<=5%--->H0 is rejected
              --->H1 ia accepted.
			  
			  5%--->
			  1%
			  10%
			  15%
			  20%

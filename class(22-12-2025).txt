Probability:
-chances of occurrence of the event
sure event
impossible event
mutually exclusive events.
0<=P<=1

Random variable:
-Random variable is a function which maps the SS into the real value.
-Random variable are classified into two types--
1.Discrete Random variable :
  DRV-->will take a discrete data
  -for a discrete random variable we have a discrete probability
  distribution.

2.Continuous random variable:
  CRV--->will take a continuos data.
  -for a continuous random variable we have a continuous probability
  distribution.
  
  ex:toss a coin 2 times probality of getting x head..
  
  SS-->{HH,HT,TH,TT}
  X-->represents th eno of heads-->discrete value 
  X=0--->0 heads 
  X=1--->1 heads 
  X=2--->2 heads---
  X is dicrete random variable

	 5                   6
	 
	 
	 X-->no of iphone sold  
	 
	 X=0--->0 iphone sold
	 
	 
	 P(X=1)=what is the probability that the one iphone is getting
	        sold

Discrete Probability Distribution:
-Discrete Random variable.
-probability is getting represented with the help of PMF
-PMF--->probability mass funtion.

Tossing a coin 2 times proabbility of getting x-heads..
X--->discrete Random variable.
X--->no of heads 
SS={HH,HT,TH,TT}

x=0,1,2--->possible values of X 

P(X=0)=1/4
P(X=1)=1/2
P(x=2)=1/4

probability mass function it maps sample sapce to real value and
real value to the probability.

-we have a various kinds of discrete probability distribution:
1.Bernaullis*
2.Binomial*
3.Poissons
4.Uniform distribution*

1.Benaullis distribution:
-discrete probability distribution 
-it is haing only two possible outcomes-->success or Failure.
ex:Tossing a coin and getting a head..
   X=getting a head 
   P(X=getting head)--->probability of success 
   P(x=getting tail)--->Probabbility of Failue
   
   let probability of success =p 
       probability of failure=1-p 
	   
	   X~Bernaullis(P)--->
	   tossing a  coin getting head-->X~Bernaulis(0.5) 
	   
	   Tossing a coin and getting a head..
	   P(sucess)=0.5
	   P(Failure)=0.5
	   
	   probability of success-->1
	   probability of Failuer-->0
	   
	   P(X=1)-->probability of success 
	   P(X=0)-->Probability of Failue
	   
-In case of discrete probability distribution we dont have
arithmatic maen(average),IN this we have a weightted average.
-we are calculating a weighted average using expected value.
  E(X)=summation(xi*P(xi))
  
  
  
  X        P(x)
  0        1-p 
  1         p
  
  E(x)=(0*(1-p))+(1*P) --
  E(x)=p-->mean  
  
  var(x)=E(x^2)-(E(x))^2=p(1-p)
  
  SD=sqrt((p*(1-p))  
  
 daatset:email--->spam/ham
 spam=1--->probability of success 
 ham=0---->probability of failure
 
 lets take the target column--->
 
 
 text      target(spam/ham) 
 
 text1--------->spam/ham 
 each observation in this dataset is follwing the Bernaullis distribution
       Target~Bernaullis(Target=1)  
	   
	   
Iris dataset--->setosa,virginica,versicolor 

[SL,SW,PL,PW]--->predict-->
target--->species------------->bearnaullis or not?


P->setosa
(1-p)-->not setosa

Why Python?
-current market scenario-->no alternate language for python
-python-->rich set of DS and AI libraries
-programming-->

programming language:


language----->english-->mode of communication

p1----------------------->p2-->language
why you want to communicate?
express the thoughts
why?--->to solve a particular problem


what is programming language?
p1----------------------->p2-->natural language


p1------------>computer--->PL
PL is a special kind of instructions which is used to communicate with computer.

why:
hindi
english--
marathi?
telagu?--->becoz it is --->grammer-->set of rules

PL-->grammer-->langauge

python--->programming language

english---->
steps:

alphabets---->words----->sentences--->paragraph
(A-Z,a-z)


pyhton:

alphabets/--------->tokens--->instruction--->program
characeter set


character set:
english--->26 characters--->gr8

python--->128 characters--->
a-z,A-Z,0-9,,.:'"-----128 chracters


Tokens:
-Tokens are the smallest indvidual unit within the program.
-without token we will not able to write any python code.
1.Keywords
2.Identifiers
3.operators
4.seperators
5.data types
6.constants


1.Keywords:
-predefined words/reserved words-----
english--->which
-we can directly used this predefined words we dont need to tell the 
meaning
-there are 35 keywords present 

2.Identifier:
-names used in the program
-it is use to identify the data
-variable name,class name,function etc
-algerian-->rules for writing the identifier--->
1.Identifier should contains ---->
   A-Z
   a-z
   0-9
   special symbol  only one (_)underscore
2.identifier should starts with alphabets or special symbol
it should no starts with number

3.identifier should not be a keywords
4.Python is a case sensitive language
   a=2
   A=2-->both meaning is different
5.length of the identifier is upto any characters but compiler
will assume upto a specific length
3.operators:
-it is a special symbol which is used to perform the operations.
-on which we are performing the operations we called it as 
operands
ex:a+b 
+--->operators
a,b--->operands
-In a python we have different types of opeartors:
1.Arithmatic opeartors
2.Relational/comparison operators
3.logical operators
4.Bitwise operators
5.assignment operators
6.membership operators
7.Identity operators


1.Arthmatic operators:
-it is used to perform arithmatic operations
operators              maening
 +                     addition
 -                     sub
 *                     mul
 /                     div
 //                    floor divison
 %                     modulus
 **                    power
 
 
 a//b---->least integer value
 
 3.4-->3
 7.5-->7
 17.5-->
 
 
 5/2
 /--->quotient
 //--->least integer value of quotient
 %---->remainder
 
 everey operators has two things:
 -when we are solving the expression
 1.priority or precedence:
 -when we have a multiple operators present in the expression
 which operator is getting evaluated first it depends on 
 priority.
 2.associativity
 -when the operators are having the same priority then the operators
 are getting evaluated based on the associativity
 
 a=3+7*2
 a=3+7*2/2
 
   operators         priority     associativity

Numpy Broadcasting:
1.when we have any dimension numpy array with (1*1) array
the operation is always possible.
2.when both arrays dimensions are same then the operation is possible
(A)m*n    (B)m*n
3.(A)--->m*n
  (B)--->1*n------>possibe
  
4.(A)---->m*n
  (B)---->n*1---->possible
  
Task:same broadcasting rules we have to implement with list.
Normalization on Numpy:
-we are trying to bring each value of a numpy array in between
0 to 1
process:
   1.find the maximum value in the numpy array
   2.divide each number of array with maximum value
   
 Standradization on Numpy array
 arr------> arr-mean(arr)/std(arr)--->
 it folllows the SND(0,1)
 Stacking:
 1.verticle stacking
 2.horizontal stacking
 
Given a Two matrices M1 and M2 (random matrices)
WAP to find the MUltiplication of two matrices


intervew:3D matrix multiplication.....

Inverse of matrix:
 np.linalg.inv(matrix)
 -we can only find the inverse of a matrix if it is non 
 singular  det(matrix)!=0
 -if matrix is singular we cannot find the inverse
matrix must be square matrix to find the inverse
square matrix-->no of rows == no of columns

determinant:
np.linalg.det(matrix)

rank:no of indepenedent rows present in the matrix

Trace of matrix:

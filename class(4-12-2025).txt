copies and view :
copy()--->deep copy
-once we copy the array it is created a new copy of that array
both new and old array are at the differenet memory location.
-changes made in one array will not affect the other
view()--->shallow copy
-once we create a view of array its is not created another copy
it is pointinng to the same array
-changes made in one array will affect the other array

syntax:
       np.shares_memory(array1,array2)
it will return True when array1 and arry2 are holding the 
same memory location
else-->it return False


numpy ---->fixed size--->static allocation
-numpy is memory efficient
-for each element in the numpy only one block od memory
is getting created

list------->variable size--->dynamic allocation.
-for one element 2 block of memory is created
-list is not a memory efficient

Numpy is faster than the list..

Pandas:
-pandas is used for data manipulation,data cleaning and 
data preprocessing
-data manipulation:retieving a data..
  SQL-->DML commands
-Data cleaning:
 structure problem
 noisy data etc
-preprocessing:before processing a data we are rying to make some
changes.
-pandas uses two kind of data structures
1.Data series or series data
2.Data Frame

Dataset--->Tabular structure-->it is having a rows and columns
row---->observation/Tuple
column--->attribute/feature/label

1.Data series or series data:
-when we have only one row or only one column then we can
called it as series data.
2.Data Frame:
-when we have more than one row or one column then we called 
it as data frame.

Syntax:
       import pandas as pd
	   import---->keyword
	   pandas----->library name
	   pd--------->alias
